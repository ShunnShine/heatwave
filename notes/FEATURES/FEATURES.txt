-- A list of smaller QoL or polish features for reference --

	currently, logs can be placed anywhere, even though the cursor highlights red when it is colliding with 
another object. I am not sure where the conditional for this color change is, but there should be an added 
function to prevent pathfinding while it is red

	Make it so that the log cursor dissapears when hovering over a selectable
object (e.g. another beaver (when hovering over other logs with the log cursor, the placed log highlighting
should be turned off, rather than the log cursor))

	A right click menu, which allows you to choose to focus on a beaver, rather than it automatically focusing.
This menu would also serve other purposes later on, such as being able to view beaver information, skills, etc.

	Make it so that the tile selection square is thicker when zoomed in
	
	Make it so that the log will move with the beaver
